# # PlayerHand.py
# The PlayerHand.py file will contain the definition of a PlayerHand class. This will keep track of the cards a player has in their hand, implemented as a BST. The PlayerHand will manage Card objects based on their suit and rank.
# 
# * __init__(self) - the constructor for the PlayerHand will simply initialize the empty BST.
# In addition to the construction of the BST in this class, the following methods are required to be implemented:
# 
# * getTotalCards(self) - returns the total number of cards in hand
# * getMin(self) - returns the card with the lowest value from the playerâ€™s hand. Returns None if there is no card in the hand
# * getSuccessor(self, suit, rank) - attempts to finds the Card with the suit and rank, and returns the card with the next greatest value Returns None if there is no card with the specified suit and rank, or if the Card is the maximum and has no successor
# * put(self, suit, rank) - this adds a card with the specified suit and rank to the BST. If that Card already exists in the BST, increment the count for that Card
# * delete(self, suit, rank) - attempts to find the Card with the specified suit and rank, and decrements the Card count. If the count is 0 after decrementing the count, remove the node from the BST entirely. Returns True if the Card was successfully removed or decremented, and False if the card is not present in the BST
# * isEmpty(self) - returns True if there are no cards in the BST and returns False otherwise
# * get(self, suit, rank) - attempts to find the Card with the specified suit and rank, and returns the Card object if it exists. Otherwise, return None
# * inOrder(self) - returns a string with the in-order traversal of the BST. Printing the in-order traversal should help check that the cards are in the correct order in the tree
# * preOrder(self) - returns a string with the pre-order traversal of the BST. BSTs with the same structure should always have the same pre-order traversal, so this can be used to verify that everything was inserted correctly
